# MuteDeck Stream Deck Plugin (Fork with Push-To-Talk)

This is a **fork** of the official [MuteDeck](https://mutedeck.com/) Stream Deck plugin, adding the **Push-To-Talk** feature.

## About MuteDeck

Control Zoom, Teams, Webex, Google Meet, Jitsi Meet, Riverside.fm, StreamYard, Discord, and other apps. Quickly mute or unmute, toggle your webcam, start sharing, leave the meeting, and more! You can even define custom actions. Take control of your meetings and streams with MuteDeck.

MuteDeck runs on Windows, macOS, and detects the status of conference call software. Currently, Zoom, Google Meet, Riverside.fm, StreamYard, Microsoft Teams, and Webex are supported (with more to come). However! If MuteDeck does not recognize your conference call software, it controls the system mute. That means you can use it for any and all types of software!

## Fork Addition: Push-To-Talk

This fork adds a **Push-To-Talk** action to the Stream Deck plugin. Instead of toggling mute on/off with a single press, Push-To-Talk allows you to:

- **Hold the button** to unmute
- **Release the button** to mute again

This is useful for scenarios where you want to speak briefly without leaving your microphone open.
